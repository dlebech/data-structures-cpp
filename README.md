data-structures-cpp
===================

This repository contains a few data structures written in C++ while teaching
[CIS 323 Data Structures Lab](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Classes/10W/cis323/) at
the University of Oregon in Winter 2010 (Jan-March 2010).

Data structures
---------------

* Trees
 * Binary search tree (BST)
 * Red-black tree
 * Left-leaning red-black tree
* Lists and arrays
 * Linked List
 * Heap & heap-sort

Testing
-------

There are probably a few errors and mishaps in the code and there is no real
test suite included. Just a short program that tries out the different
features. Maybe this will change in the future. Who knows.

    g++ test.cpp -o test
    ./test
